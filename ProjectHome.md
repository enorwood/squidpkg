# SquidPKG #
## Cross-platform Automatic Software Deployment ##

SquidPKG is an automatic software deployment script, loosely modeled on the WPKG program for Windows deployment (http://wpkg.org/). This was developed for the University of Washington Department of Environmental and Occupation Health Science IT group to enable us to have WPKG-like functionality on department Apple desktop computers. SquidPKG is written in Python. It is currently compatible with Python version 2.6 (Possibly 2.5 and 2.7, this is untested).

Currently SquidPKG has only been tested with Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6, however it should work on all platforms.

# SquidPKG #

Welcome to SquidPKG, a cross-platform automatic software deployment script. SquidPKG was modeled after [WPKG](http://wpkg.org), a Windows software deployment utility. Though SquidPKG lacks many of the sophisticated features of WPKG at this point, it is written in Python and able to run on any platform.

SquidPKG was developed for the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences IT group to get WPKG-like functionality on department Apple desktop computers.


Please browse the rest of this Wiki for help with setup, running SquidPKG, and example XML files for various software.
